=== Creating a new project in Firebase
	1) Go to Firebase console - https://console.firebase.google.com/
	2) Add a new project, create a name of project (in my case it will be
		"weather-SPA") and press "Next", Firebase created unique name for my project
		automaticly (weather-spa-c5720)
	3) We should disable Google analytics because uor project is very simple and
		we need not in it, press "Create" and wait
	4) Go to "Hosting" tab and press "Start"

=== Install FireBase and login
	1) Commsnd "sudo npm install -g firebase-tools"
	2) Command "firebase login"
	3) Web browser should open webpage with login form. Choose account and give
		access to firebase for using this account

=== Make Build of project
	1) Command "npm run build"
	2) This command adds new folder "build" to our project

=== Configuration of deployment
	--- In next steps you should move cursor by up and down keys, mark options by
		space button and for next step - press Enter
	1) Command "firebase init"
	2) Mark only "Hosting: Configure and deploy Firebase Hosting sites" and press Enter
	3) Choose "Use an existing project" because we have the project already
	4) Choose project, in my case it is "weather-spa-c5720 (weather-SPA)"
	5) Write name of folder which will be use for deploying, in our case it is "build"
	6) Set our project like SPA and all requests will be sending to "index.html"
	7) Choose "DON'T replace index.html", it's asking us because we have
		"index.html" file in "build" folder already
	8) After finish we will have 2 files:
		- .firebaserc - it contents a name of project
		- firebase.json - it contents a settings, what we adjusted
